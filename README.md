This is a study guide built by Rush Burriel to help myself and other bootcamp students succeed in becoming knowledgeable in coding and web developement. This guide will contain notes on HTML, JavaScript, Git as well as CSS. It is the first webpage I have designed and I am very excited to progress from here. Thank you for looking.
